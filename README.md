Code Explanation
The logic for the game is in the app.js file: questions are stored as objects, each with a question, an array of choices, and the correct choice
Each question, in sequential order, is displayed for the user to answer, and the chosen answer is compared to correct answer
The correct answer is inserted in the HTML element as an id attribute so that the comparison can actually be made in app.js
Depending on the outcome, variables for correct/incorrect/unanswered questions are incremented and appropriate messages are displayed
